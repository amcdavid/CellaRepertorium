Description: Methods to cluster and analyze high-throughput
    single cell immune cell repertoires, especially from the 10X Genomics
    VDJ solution. Contains an R interface to CD-HIT (Li and Godzik 2006).   
    Methods to visualize and analyze paired heavy-light chain data.
    Tests for specific expansion, as well as omnibus oligoclonality under
    hypergeometric models.
