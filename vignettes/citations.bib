abstract = {Since the discovery of T cells that express two T cell receptors (TCRs), termed dual TCR cells, most studies have focused on their autoimmune potential, while their beneficial roles remained elusive. We identified, in normal mice, dual TCR cells that participated in the immune response to a foreign antigen. Unlike single TCR cells, dual TCR cells used the nonselected TCR to respond in the periphery, but relied on coexpression of a second TCR for intrathymic selection. We found that they were selected at low frequency in the na{\"{i}}ve repertoire, but dominated the response to antigen through clonal expansion. Thus, dual TCR cells can extend the TCR repertoire for foreign antigens by rescuing functional TCRs that cannot be selected on single TCR cells; they can, therefore, benefit the immune system. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Although many T cells carry two in-frame V$\alpha$ rearrangements, the products of both V$\alpha$ rearrangements have never been shown simultaneously on the surface of normal cells. With the use of monoclonal antibodies to V$\alpha$2, V$\alpha$12, and V $\alpha$24, up to one-third of mature T cells expressed two V $\alpha$ chains as part of two functional and independent T cell receptors (TCRs). Thus, the "one cell, one receptor" rule does not apply to a large subset of $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells. Cells that belong to this dual TCR subset may be specific for a broader range of antigens than cells with a single receptor, which may be important for autoimmunity and alloreactivity.},

@article{Padovan1995,
abstract = {We have examined the extent of allelic exclusion at the T cell receptor (TCR)$\beta$ locus using monoclonal antibodies specific for V$\beta$ products. A small proportion (-1{\%}) of human peripheral blood T cells express two V$\beta$ as determined by flow cytometric analysis, isolation of representative clones, and sequencing of the corresponding V$\beta$ chains. Dual $\beta$ T cells are present in both the CD45R0+ and CD45R0− subset. These results indicate that dual $\beta$ expression is compatible with both central and peripheral selection. They also suggest that the substantial degree of TCR$\beta$ allelic exclusion is dependent only on asynchronous rearrangements at the $\beta$ locus, whereas the role of the pre-TCR is limited to signaling the presence of at least one functional $\beta$ protein. {\textcopyright} 1995, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {SUMMARY CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions. AVAILABILITY http://cd-hit.org.
